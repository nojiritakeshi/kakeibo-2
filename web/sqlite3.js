// This file is loaded by the browser and provides the SQLite functionality
// It's a placeholder for the actual sqlite3.js file that should be downloaded from:
// https://github.com/tekartik/sqflite/raw/master/packages_web/sqflite_common_ffi_web/assets/sqlite3.js

// The actual file is quite large, so we're creating a placeholder here.
// In a production environment, you should download the actual file from the URL above.
